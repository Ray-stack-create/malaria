# Malaria cell detection


Malaria is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. It is a major public health problem, and can lead to severe illness and death if left untreated. Early diagnosis is essential as it can help save the severity or deteriorating health condition. One approach that we can use in the diagnosis of malaria is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are a type of artificial intelligence model that is particularly well-suited for image classification tasks. CNNs can be trained to recognize patterns in images of infected blood cells and make a diagnosis based on those patterns.


## Libraries and Running procedure

To run this project, you will need to install the following libraries-
1. `pip install pandas`
2. `pip install numpy`
3. `pip install matplotlib`
4. `pip insall open-cv`
5. `pip install tensorflow`
6. `pip install tqdm`
7. `pip install scikit-learn`
8. `pip install keras`
9. `pip install pillow`

First train the `malaria.ipynp` file in your jupyter notebook.

Then in your `command prompt` locate the directory where you saved the files and run `streamlit run app.py` (paste complete path of the app.py file). Make sure you install streamlit first.
